// From piquet web3d/src/faces.js @ 254cb3c; cassino's change is the strip
// (below).
// The Jumbo Index faces: for a phone, where a fanned hand shows each card
// only by its corner, faces that are nothing but index -- the rank large in
// the platform's bold UI font (San Francisco on an iPhone), the suit larger
// beneath it, on one axis, at the top left; and right of it, for the
// table, the rank over the suit again, as large as the card holds. Drawn here with
// Canvas 2D, so no font is bundled or fetched.
//
// From the user's own recipe (1 October 2026), kept as given in the commit
// that brought it, d2507ac. What differs, for the table: the face is paper
// from edge to edge, because the table's ink line draws every card's edge
// and rounds its corners (the classic art has no border either); the faces
// are drawn at the classic art's width for the screen (art.js); and, at the
// user's word (2 October), the index is fitted into the strip of each card
// a fanned hand shows, rather than drawn at the recipe's sizes and covered:
// "make the font on each card *just* big enough to be seen in that space,
// with a smidge of space on either side (a handful of pixels)".
//
// Settings calls them "Large Text (Optimized for smaller screens)" (the
// user's words). They are the default on phones and tablets, the classic
// faces on computers; Settings can choose either anywhere, and the change is
// live.
