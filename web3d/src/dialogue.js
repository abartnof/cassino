// From piquet web3d/src/dialogue.js @ 254cb3c, with cassino's `skip`.
// The dialogue at the table: the phrases speech.js asks for, each given its
// words and its moment, for the declarations' dialogue boxes. The words are
// the phrase bank's (web3d/tools/phrases.py, docs/PHRASES.md), bundled into
// the page by web3d/build.py.
//
// Everything is said in several ways, and each is picked without repeating
// the last (bag.js). Each line waits for its moment -- the animation's beat
// for the event it belongs to -- and for the line before it to have been
// said, so a box never appears before its turn.
//
// createDialogue(bank, clock) -> { say(lines, onLine), words(lines), plan(lines), estimate(lines), stop() }
//   bank:   { groups: { id: [key] }, texts: { key: words } }
//   clock:  ms now -- the table's clock, which stops while the table is held
//           still, so time held is not counted as time passed
//   lines:  [{ who: "you"|"them", phrase, delay, at, chatter, vars }] from
//           speech(): phrase is a group id; delay the ms from now until its
//           moment (0 if absent); at, the event it belongs to; chatter, a
//           remark that yields to the calls (below); vars, the words its
//           text's {slots} are filled with ("{Lead}" capitalised).
//           Or { pause: true, delay }: the moment between the declarations'
//           rounds (breaks.js), which comes once the line before it has been
//           said, and before which nothing after it comes.
//   onLine: (line, words, ms) for each line, ms from now until it is said
//           (words null for a pause)
